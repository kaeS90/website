          Hi, I'm Kel, a fantasy writer in my mid-thirties living in the
          Appalachian foothills of South Carolina, a magical place if ever there
          was one. Growing up, I was always the kid who looked twice at that
          flicker in the corner of my eye, hoping to catch a glimpse of the
          unexpected. Now, I write wonder-infused stories about what happens
          when that glimpse becomes a wide-eyed stare.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world is full of inexplicable magic, including the alchemy that
          happens inside us through our relationships and experiences. That
          magic is what I explore in my books, which feature characters exactly
          as ordinary and magical as you or me (who also maybe fly or fight
          nightmares or jump through time because, hey, it's fantasy).
        </p>
        <p>
          To hear more about my stories and writing process, sign up for my
          monthly email newsletter at the top of the page. I also send out
          monthly book reviews on what I'm reading, as well as freebies and
          resources I come across related to fantasy and storytelling.
